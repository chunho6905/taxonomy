      Information about the basic characteristics of squid in the West Sea. This
      focuses on their habitat preferences and location patterns.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Where are the primary habitats of squid in the West Sea?
        answer: >-
          Squid in the West Sea primarily inhabit the coastal waters around
          Incheon, Yeongheung Island, Deokjeok Island, Taean, and Boryeong. They
          show a strong preference for areas with rocky and gravelly bottoms at
          depths of 10-20 meters, particularly favoring locations with uneven
          bottom structures that provide natural shelter.
      - question: How do seasonal changes affect squid habitat selection?
        answer: |-
          Squid in the West Sea change their habitat preferences seasonally:
          - Spring: Move to shallow coastal waters (5-10m) for breeding
          - Summer: Retreat to deeper waters (15-20m) to avoid high temperatures
          - Fall: Return to medium depths (10-15m) for active feeding
          - Winter: Stay in deeper offshore waters for protection
      - question: What bottom features do squid prefer in their habitat?
        answer: |-
          Squid prefer habitats with:
          1. Rocky or gravelly bottom structure
          2. Natural or artificial reefs
          3. Areas with moderate current flow
          4. Clear water conditions
          5. Varied depth profiles within their territory

      Detailed information about the depth preferences and vertical movement
      patterns of West Sea squid.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the optimal depth range for squid in the West Sea?
        answer: >-
          The optimal depth range for West Sea squid varies but generally falls
          between 10-20 meters. The most active feeding typically occurs at 5-15
          meters during dawn and dusk. They adjust their depth based on water
          temperature, light conditions, and prey availability.
      - question: How do squid move vertically through the water column?
        answer: |-
          Squid exhibit distinct vertical movement patterns:
          - Daytime: Stay deeper (15-20m) to avoid bright light
          - Dawn/Dusk: Move to middle depths (8-12m) for feeding
          - Night: May come to shallower waters (5-10m) while hunting
          - They also adjust depth based on temperature and prey location
      - question: What environmental factors influence squid depth selection?
        answer: |-
          Several key factors influence squid depth selection:
          1. Water temperature (prefer 13-20°C)
          2. Light intensity
          3. Prey distribution
          4. Current strength
          5. Oxygen levels

      West Sea squid throughout the year.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: When are the peak activity seasons for West Sea squid?
        answer: |-
          The peak activity seasons for West Sea squid are:
          1. Spring (March-May): Active breeding period
          2. Fall (September-November): Peak feeding activity
      - question: What characterizes squid behavior during breeding season?
        answer: |-
          During breeding season (Spring):
          - Increased movement to coastal areas
          - More active during daylight hours
          - Form larger groups
          - More aggressive feeding behavior
          - More responsive to artificial lures
      - question: How do squid behave during summer and winter?
        answer: |-
          Summer and winter behaviors include:
          Summer:
          - Reduced activity due to high temperatures
          - Move to deeper, cooler waters
          - Feed mainly during early morning and late evening
          Winter:
          - Limited activity in deep waters
          - Reduced feeding frequency
          - Tend to stay in stable depth zones

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the primary prey items for West Sea squid?
        answer: |-
          West Sea squid primarily feed on:
          1. Small crustaceans (crabs, shrimp)
          2. Small fish up to 1/3 their body size
          3. Various shellfish species
          4. Juvenile fish
      - question: When are the peak feeding times for squid?
        answer: |-
          Squid feeding activity peaks:
          - Primary: Dusk to early evening
          - Secondary: Dawn to early morning
          - Reduced: Bright daylight hours
          - Variable: During cloudy or overcast conditions
      - question: How do water conditions affect squid feeding behavior?
        answer: |-
          Water conditions affecting feeding behavior include:
          1. Clarity: Prefer clear water for hunting
          2. Temperature: Most active in 13-20°C
          3. Tide: More active during moderate tidal movement
          4. Moon Phase: More active during darker moon phases

          - Stable barometric pressure
          - Light to moderate winds
          - Absence of heavy rainfall
      - question: How do tidal movements affect squid behavior?
        answer: |-
          Tidal influences on squid behavior:
          - Prefer moderate tidal flows
          - More active during tide changes
          - Move with tidal currents to conserve energy
          - Use tidal movements to ambush prey
          - Often more catchable during slack tide periods
      - question: What role does water temperature play in squid activity?
        answer: |-
          Water temperature effects include:
          1. Optimal range: 13-20°C for maximum activity
          2. Below 12°C: Reduced activity and feeding
          3. Above 22°C: Move to deeper, cooler waters
          4. Seasonal movements track preferred temperatures
          5. Temperature changes can trigger migration patterns
